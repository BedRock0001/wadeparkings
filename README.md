I began my developer journey in April of 2020, starting at the very top of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. I picked up my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, node.js, React, and D3. Some of those tools stuck, while others did not. After completing the Full Stack web development certification, I started exploring TypeScript and fell in love with it. I used it first for a couple of small projects, then ended up building a Discord bot with it. When freeCodeCamp rolled out the Python curriculum I started exploring Python - but I ended up tabling those studies until later on. I recently picked up Angular and began exploring it, and so far am greatly enjoying what it has to offer!

All my projects are available here on GitHub. You can view my top projects/contributions pinned below this introduction, or you can browse my repositories to see what I have built. Everything I build is open-source, and you are free to fork the repository and play around with the code. If you ever discover a bug or want to request a feature, feel free to submit issues or pull requests â€” they are always welcome! Please review our contributing guidelines and Code of Conduct first â€” and see the project's versions for information specific to that project!

Looking for a repository and don't see it? I keep all of my old, deprecated projects in a separate archive to keep my repository list clean.

I may be contacted through my Chat Server or via email form.
